    Together with this year’s excited project group we wish to welcome you to D-Dagen 2019! We continuously work with improving D-Dagen to make it as great as possible for everyone studying computer science at KTH. For us, this means planning interesting events around the fair and broadening the range to create more value for the students who participate.
    <br><br>
    We have also continued our efforts with getting a good distribution of companies from different business segments in order to create a fair where students and companies can meet in a simple way regardless of how far along you are in your studies! In addition, the size of the fair has continued to increase and we are larger than ever before with a total of 79 companies attending the fair.
    <br><br>
    We in the project group hope to see you at D-Dagen 2019!
